version 0.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Split the PSDCutter into two logical entities.
                The PSDCutterCore is the functional part of the script, it 
                contains all the logic from previous versions but is organized 
                in the way that is callable by external code like PSDCutterGUI.
                The PSDCutter now just calls the PSDCutterCore, so it continues
                being callable from the ExtendedToolscript tool.

version 0.1.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Create the About UI.

version 0.1.2:
[Sep 02 2015] - Update the Main Dialog to a bigger size, we previous runs 
                we find that it was too small to check the output path 
                in deeply nested folders, and the script output text box
                runs out of space very shortly, requiring that uses scrolls
                frequently.
                Disables the build button if no documents are open.

version 0.1.1
[Sep 02 2015] - Update the run code to show an alert box if no open documents 
                are found. 
                Put a dummy default output folder in case of no open documents
                just to not crash the script.
