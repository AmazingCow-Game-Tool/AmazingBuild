version 0.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Split the PSDCutter into two logical entities.
                The PSDCutterCore is the functional part of the script, it 
                contains all the logic from previous versions but is organized 
                in the way that is callable by external code like PSDCutterGUI.
                The PSDCutter now just calls the PSDCutterCore, so it continues
                being callable from the ExtendedToolscript tool.
version 0.1.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Create the About UI.
