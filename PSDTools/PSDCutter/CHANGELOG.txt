version 0.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Split the PSDCutter into two logical entities.
                The PSDCutterCore is the functional part of the script, it
                contains all the logic from previous versions but is organized
                in the way that is callable by external code like PSDCutterGUI.
                The PSDCutter now just calls the PSDCutterCore, so it continues
                being callable from the ExtendedToolscript tool.

version 0.1.1:
[Aug 29 2015] - Create the About UI.

version 0.1.2:
[Sep 02 2015] - Update the Main Dialog to a bigger size, we previous runs
                we find that it was too small to check the output path
                in deeply nested folders, and the script output text box
                runs out of space very shortly, requiring that uses scrolls
                frequently.
                Disables the build button if no documents are open.

version 0.1.3:
[Sep 08 2015] - Add the ability to specify a Post Run Script for execution
                when the PSDCutterCore ends the processing.
                Add the ability to select if the Scenes and Prefabs will be
                saved in separated folders.

version 0.1.4:
[oct 12 2015] - Fix bug on about dialog of PSDCutterGUI.
                The about dialog is failing due a hardcoded font that was
                maybe not preent in all systems.

version 0.1.1
[Sep 02 2015] - Update the run code to show an alert box if no open documents
                are found.
                Put a dummy default output folder in case of no open documents
                just to not crash the script.

version 0.1.2
[Sep 08 2015] - Add the ability to select if the Scenes and Prefabs will be
                saved in separated folders.
                Change the saveLayer signature, so now it just asks for the
                save name of the layer instead of fullpath.

version 0.1.3
[Sep 24 2015] - Make PSDCutterCore use the new PSDHelpers (v0.1.4).
                Fix some bugs on Button's disabledLayer settings.
