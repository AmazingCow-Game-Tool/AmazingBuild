# Amazing Build

## About:

Amazing Build is a collection of useful programs intended to ease some cumbersome operations.   
The main motivation to this project is make the computer work hard and
let you do more useful/creative stuff.   
Right now we have a PSDCutter and a PSDIconMaker, but some other programs is planned to be  
part of the Amazing Build suite.

We hope that Amazing Build helps you...
And of course, it is made with <3 and a lot of coffee.

If you are using Amazing Build somehow, please let us know.   
We gonna be very proud and happy to see our work being useful to another people.

**Don't be shy, hack it... share it...** 

## TODO:

We have a very long list of things that must be done, but our time (everyone's time)
is very, very short.    
We gonna make all the planned programs as it's needed, but you
are very welcome to help us build them.

Mainly today we have planned:

##### Gimp:

* All PSDTools to Gimp, so we can build stuff in a Free Software image editor 
and in all platforms.

##### General: 

* SpriteSheetMaker - A tool to build SpriteSheets, similar to TexturePacker but
made of free software.

Check each ```TODO``` file inside the desired Amazing Build program to more info
